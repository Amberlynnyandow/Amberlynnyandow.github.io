My endeavors into the field of Data Science were not sprung from some sort of epiphany or awakening. Put simply, I was strongly motivated to change career paths and I knew I wanted it to be tech related. After all, technology is our future and I know roughly nothing about it. During my undergraduate studies, I enjoyed statistics and calculus among other things such as chemistry, politics and cartography. After a multitude of personality tests, career assessments and Forbes related articles listing the fastest growing industries, I started to familiarize myself with Data Science. 

The first word, data, gets me a bit aroused. Thinking about neat files arranged like Monica Geller’s bathroom towels fills me with joy. Color-coded with specific purposes and all! Not to mention, Data is the name of a beloved character of Star Trek the Next Generation. One of the greatest TV shows of all time. The second word Science brings back memories of my childhood when I used to mix cornstarch and water to produce “slime”. Which is obviously every kids favorite toy. And I will never forget the day I decided to put Mentos candies into my coca cola on the living room couch. A friend up the street had told me what would happen, but I did not believe him. That’s the beauty of science, right? If someone makes a claim stating, if X then Y, we can all go out and test that hypothesis for ourselves. I probably should have tested my friends claim outdoors then I could have avoided an hour of scrubbing the couch and floor. 

While studying at Monroe community College, I took an elective course titled Introduction to Geographic Information Systems. I had some familiarity with programs that I used for my chemistry labs but that was the extent of my computer knowledge. Each day was a new challenge that I typically felt was over my head. If it wasn’t for my cat-like curiosity I may have given up on the course. Needless to say, I got to make some sweet maps. More importantly, I got to see the imaginative maps of my fellows.

The amount of information that can be derived from a map is immense. Physical, political or thematic, you can input variables and create detailed visualizations. You want to know the countries where it is illegal to own a pet monkey. Make a map. You want to design a futuristic visual prediction about sea levels rising. Make a map. Income, weather, natural resources are just a few more intriguing examples. Getting into analyzing spatial data would involve becoming intensely familiar with a geographic information system since maps have moved from your glove box to your cellular phone. This type of software is very specific and can help you do essentially one thing particularly well, make maps. As much fun as I had in this course, it was not enough to compel me to switch majors, again.
	
Truth be told, I did hop around from major to major in college. Constantly searching for the path, I was supposed to be on. It was an arduous journey, but the hard work paid off. I found classes that sparked an interest in me I did not know I had. Actually, I should say it sparked a passion I did not know I had. Data was interesting. The ideas that flowed from analyzing data made me feel eager to discover more. Unfortunately, I left college shortly after that. My mother and brother had both passed during my time at SUNY Albany and I soon found myself back home and working in an industry I was comfortable with, hospitality. 

	
After some serious self-reflection I was determined to get back the passion I had lost. Now, we are back where we started, my reflection lead me to Data Science. This particular field had come up a few times in those assessments I mentioned earlier. Due to my lack of familiarity with the field I decided to spend quite a bit of time researching it. My first impressions of the field were illuminating. I grew excited to think that with some hard work I could take data, analyze it and create neat visuals to describe my findings just like I had with the GIS course. In the beginning, I was quite optimistic. My motivation to dive into this field was immense like a child first discovering sugar. I wanted more and more! There were many options on the table. Taking an introductory online course seemed the best fit. The course was grueling. I saw the tippy top of the iceberg and had no idea how vast it was underneath the water. After a year of trying to teach myself to code and not getting far I made the decision to throw some money into accomplishing my goal.

Computer programing was never something I considered an option for a career path. I took a look at myself and said, “What are your strengths? What are your weaknesses? What makes you happy?” These inquires took me down a rabbit hole to find myself, my true self. It is probable that I am still in the hole but much like the outcome of my flip-flopping in college, I am destined to discover passions I did not know I had.
