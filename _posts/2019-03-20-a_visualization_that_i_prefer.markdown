A box plot or box and whiskers plot, is as simple as any other plot or data diagram. It displays the five-number summary of a data set. In other words, it is a visual representation of the distribution of data. For many people, the box plot was their first visual introduction to statistics. It is especially useful for indicating whether a distribution is skewed and whether there are potential outliers in the data set. The plot is ideal for comparing two or more distributions because the centre, spread and overall range are immediately apparent. The most common reason for using a box plot is to show a clear summary of a large data set.
